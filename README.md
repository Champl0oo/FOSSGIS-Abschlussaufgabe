### Automating the search for the most suitable location for an emission free grocery delivery service using multi-criteria and network analysis.

# General information 

Grocery Delivery Services are becomming more and more popular especially in the light of the pandemic.
Therefore we created a model using QGIS, which automatically generates a map depicting the most suitable location for an emission free goocery delivery service in a city of your choice. There are a couple of different criteria aswell as issues regarding distance and pathing which is why we are sing both multi-critera and network analysis.

### Criteria Examples:
  - Distance to supermarkets
  - reachable distance by bike in 15min
  - population/building density
  - road quality for cycling
